### Project Description
This quirky web-based project explores a hilariously alternate version of history: What if the apple missed Newton’s head?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if the apple missed Newton’s head?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
In this interactive game, a virtual apple falls from a tree at random angles. With a 50% chance to bonk Newton right on the head, users witness one of two equally ridiculous outcomes:

💥 Bonk at 90° – Newton gets hit, cries, and is tragically destined to study gravity.

💘 Misses – Newton dodges the apple and lives happily ever after... by getting married!

## Technical Details
